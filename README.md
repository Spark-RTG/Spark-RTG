- 👋 Hi, I’m Spark-RTG, an undergraduate at Georgia Institute of Technology.
- 👀 I’m interested in Software Development,
I have about half year's experience working on web applications and mobile Android applications. 
I love to self-learn things and crack down various difficulties. I've done several extracurricular projects by myself during my spare time.
I also enjoy cooperating with others. Indeed, I'm always eager to find great people to work with!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the server-side technologies for both web applications and Android applications.
I'm willing to post my project after fully acquiring the skill set.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on mobile application development.
I'm currently working on an Android application for office and self use to distribute tasks. It requires tons of work,
and I'm currently working with it only by myself. I know this trains my skills better, but I sometimes need help for the expansion of software features.
- 📫 How to reach me: you can send an email to my personal mailbox: sparklight@gatech.edu I'm glad to see you!
